* Installing SLAMBench on Mac
- Edit flags (-p, -rf) in Makefiles to be before strings
  - framework/makefiles/download_benchmarks.py
  - framework/makefiles/eigen3.make
- Install prerequisites if you haven't already done so (I used Homebrew)
  - CMake
    - brew install cmake
  - Make
    - brew install make
  - GCC C/C++
    - brew install gcc
  - Boost
    - brew install boost
  - GLUT (left out for now)
  - wget
    - brew install wget
  - yaml
    - brew install libyaml (do I still need this?)
    - brew install yaml-cpp
  - Install Mercurial to make eigen3
    - brew install hg
- make eigen3
- Comment out "#define ENABLE_MEM_PROFILING" in framework/shared/src/sb_malloc.cpp
** Speeding up compilation
- make -j4 to use 4 processors
- ccache to cache files that have already been compiled

* Bug fix
** DONE Git commits (from 15-07-2019)
- Makefile change can be discarded
- Separate flag rearrangements from rest of changes
- Commit changes and submit pull request
** DONE TUMReader bug
- TUMReader class
  - For definition of TUMReader
- TUM.cpp
  - GenerateSLAMFile() function
    - Tries to access fr1_intrinsics, fr2... but they are of type constexpr
      - LLVM ignores the constexpr variables and so need to maybe shift it to GenerateSLAMFile() in TUM.cpp
- Same bug in ICLReader
- Fixed by moving "static constexpr" variables to be within respective GenerateSLAMFile() function definitions
** DONE whole-archive
- Doesn't work with clang
  - Replaced with working equivalents for clang (-noall_load)
** DONE Pangolin bug
- Refactored shell script flags in makefile
- Workaround to avoid use of sysinfo functions for now

*** Testing fix
- Evaluating a benchmark (from repo README.md)
